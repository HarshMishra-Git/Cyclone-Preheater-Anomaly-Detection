# Slide 1: Project Overview

**Title:** Cyclone Preheater Anomaly Detection  
**Objective:** Identify abnormal operating periods in cyclone preheater process data to ensure operational efficiency and safety.  
**Dataset:** Raw sensor/log data from cyclone preheater equipment.

# Slide 2: Data Preparation

- **Raw Data Collected:** Temperature, pressure, and other process variables at regular intervals.
- **Preprocessing Steps:**
  - Removed missing or corrupted records to ensure data quality.
  - Resampled time-series data for consistent intervals.
  - Applied normalization/scaling for comparability.
  - Performed outlier removal (when clearly erroneous).
- **Reasoning:**
  - Ensured a clean, consistent dataset suitable for analysis and model training.
  - Normalization helped algorithms detect subtle anomalies across different sensor scales.

# Slide 3: Analysis Strategy

- **Methodology:**
  - Visualized data trends to understand normal vs abnormal patterns.
  - Used statistical thresholds and anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, Z-score) to flag unusual periods.
  - Cross-referenced flagged periods with process logs for validation.
- **Tools & Libraries:** Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib).

# Slide 4: Insights & Results

- **Key Findings:**
  - Most process variables followed expected operational ranges.
  - Detected abnormal spikes/drops in temperature and pressure during specific periods.
  - Abnormal periods aligned with maintenance logs or unexpected shutdowns.
- **How Were Anomalies Identified?**
  - Marked periods where variable values exceeded 3 standard deviations from the mean or were flagged by the anomaly detection model.
- **Impact:**
  - Early detection of anomalies helps prevent costly downtime and maintain safety.

# Slide 5: Conclusion

- **Summary:**  
  - Effective data preparation and analysis enabled reliable anomaly detection.
  - Model highlighted actionable abnormal periods for further investigation.
- **Next Steps:**  
  - Integrate anomaly alerts into real-time monitoring.
  - Refine detection algorithms with additional data.
